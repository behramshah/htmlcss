            The first few messages a customer receives are some of the most important.
            These messages set the tone of the experience and prepare customers with the
            information they need to know. Information at this stage of the customer journey
            also helps customers learn as much as possible about the value your products offer.
        </p>
        <p class="secondP">
            The messages above are short and simple, but they mainly work because they keep 
            customers informed. Even if you have to share difficult information with customers
            — like late deliveries — let them know.
